I get to avoid long lines especially in banks, since you can deposit using this app. You just have to go cash in through machines and other partner establishments which have no lines usually. It has also been a great help during the quarantine. Also there’s no convenience fee when paying bills when using their service unlike other apps where they charge you for it. I did encounter times where deductions to my fund were made despite transactions failing but i contacted customer service and filed a form and was refunded (just provide proof and you’re good). There was also one time where I cashed in to a wrong account (I typed a wrong number) with 15k and called the customer service and they were able to transfer it back to my correct account (again just provide proof like transaction numbers and receipts and you’re good).

I called them and said that if it was already deducted on my account meaning it was a successful transaction and I need to talk to Gcash. So, I tried reaching out to GCash customer support but still no update on my concern.

This was always a concern to me whenever I cash in via debit card, the OTP is always late. I hope you can fix this, I've been using Gcash for quite a while now.

I have done this several times today and spent more than Php200 just for verification of my card and it still won’t go through despite correct information.

G-cash hotline and online were quite helpful to confirm that payment has already been reflected on the system of G-Cash, but my Globe One account does not state the same.

They also just close tickets for no reason which you have to reopen under a new ticket, and they never read the history even when you ask them to. You can still get billed in GCash even when the transaction doesn't push through; in my case I got billed 4x the amount I initially made a purchase for.

This is a good app for cashless transactions but still has a lot to improve. Here are the problems I am experiencing 
1. When I link my BPI account here, it’s weird that it won’t take the password for my BPI app, I ended changing my password in BPI for 6 times. It always show that the password is wrong so the BPI app blocked my account and password needed to be changed.

2. Transaction History - I think it would be great if the transaction history shows the receipt generated after the transaction and by the way, sending the transaction history to my email is not working

3. In addition to the transactiob history, when I export/save the transaction receipt to my phone, it is cut off in the middle. I don’t know why but yes it is cut off right in the middle.

4. Some fields aren’t working - I am saving BIR as a biller, but when I tap on “preferred biller name” it is not working. Hence I cannot save this biller and I have to go through the usual process when I pay bills.

What I only don’t like about GCash, probably for us users, is that it made our lives disappointed when we badly need GCash for load and other online transactions.

GCash is usually doing a service maintenance that affects the entire GCash system.

I don’t know with GCash, but I suggest if they intend to update or correct their server development, it should be on their beta. It is not good that it damages the entire system, other transactions, withdrawal, cash-ins, bills, and many more - where people expect it to be used in needs of emergency.

We cannot load our mobile data and pay bills and stuffs because it’s almost everyday or every week that they do maintenance affecting the whole Gcash App.

2020-02-15 11:35:03,"Thought this was a great app until I had these issues:
1. PayQR has become scary as the confirmation sms would take time thus you will have to wait for several minutes up to an hour just to complete the transaction because there’s no way you’d want to pay again in cash when your gcash money has been deducted already. Now I don’t trust this app for payment anymore as I’m scared I would be in a rush and then have this encounter. That would be such a shame when the entire point of using this feature is because of the fast transaction.
2. Buy Load is always unavailable. Sometimes I need to buy load right away but I couldn’t because that feature is not available. Also, there’s this GoExtra90 something (not really sure of the name) that promises a 50 pesos voucher but when you try to claim it you would always get an error. I mean for what I’m paying I think the voucher is really excessive as a benefit but if the customer cannot claim it that’s false advertising and it shouldn’t be up in the promo description. Not really mad that I cannot claim it but would just want to say it shouldn’t be included in there if it really isn’t available.
3. They say you can pay Netflix through Gcash AMEX but when I try to set it up Netflix doesn’t accept it. When I contacted them they said my AMEX is not valid then I reached out to Gcash and the rep told me there should be no problem with it. When I tried to ask for how I can fix it I got no more response and I just told myself to wait but then it took ten more minutes so I just gave up. Now I don’t even know which one of them is saying the correct thing.

1. Support is, as expected, elusive. It's the ironic standard of Philippine telecommunication companies to ignore customers indefinitely whenever possible. I remember contacting support via email about 7 months ago since it was suggested by the official site the app page links to. Multiple months and follow-ups later, I still haven't received a response to this date.

2. Fingerprint authentication for applicable devices is missing. One can then only wonder when Face ID will be supported.

3. Transaction details pitifully pop up as your regular modal. Please have a proper screen for this where said information can be copied easily and viewed aesthetically.

4. SSS payments aren't supported. You'll be asked to use USSD. Other government institutions are being added but porting this one doesn't seem to be a priority in the slightest for some unknown reason.

5. BIR payments make the app crash. It turns out said service isn't working and this is without any advisory to both customers and apparently even the BIR. I'm not sure whether the latest version has sorted it out, but I'm not betting on it.

I got a prepaid SIM solely for GCash and I don't have the intention of switching networks; I simply want to use GCash as it is but not Globe. I was under the misguided impression that GCash was headed towards becoming an independent payment solution like PayMaya, but it appears it will unfortunately continue to just be a service under Globe and nothing more.",3,GlacialGoddess,False,More Vision Than Execution,gcash,520020791,

Almost a 5-star, it’s just that I feel conscious using it in public because of the big keys for MPIN which your neighbor can easily see. I hope you introduce a touch ID option+PIN(diff from mpin) like BDO’s so I can login using my fingerprint and a different pin in public too. 

I also wish sessions expire faster or more intuitively. I find out that sometimes, I leave the app only to go back and see I can still login and transact.

Favorite app for a while, until I reached my transaction limit! It’s my most hated app right now.

Disappointed that you don’t have a Transaction Limit tracker or warning 10k before the limit is reached. I can’t buy load, transfer to my gsave, shop online, pay merchants through the app. The app basically just became USELESS and a hassle (oh the opportunity cost of having 10k just lying there w/o interest) after I reached the transaction limit.

I have about 10k just sitting in my wallet (not even in my Gsave!!!), basically dead and not earning interest, because I reached my transaction limit for the month. 

I really hoped I was informed of my limit or accumulated transactions for each 10k mark.

I would really appreciate it if we’d have a tracker bar for transactions (transaction history is not enough since you have to have everything emailed to see all transactions for the month).

Please do something about this. I’m discouraged to transact with GCash now considering my funds could be frozen any moment, without warning.",2,killerbride,False,Great app!,gcash,520020791,

2020-10-14 06:53:38,"I heard a lot of bad reviews for this app. Made me want to rethink my decision to use it. I plan to use GCash to pay for my App Store since Apple is no longer downloading any Free apps without credit info. I was just at the registration page when I already encountered something ridiculous. You see, my name has a hyphen, like “John–Henry”. Of course under the given name field I’ll type “John–Henry”. But the developer decided the special character is illegal. So I’m forced to type “John Henry” which is not the same. It infuriates me when software does this to me. It infuriates me more when the developer should know better. This was probably a foretaste of the disappointment yet to come. Fortunately for Globe it wasn’t all bad. I got the app working for now but not after a big headache. 

The Cash In from Banks instructions need some updating. I tried to follow the instructions step by step. Eventually I experimented and found my way through. At least fix the East-West bank cash in instructions because that’s what I used so far. 

During Verification, the Link that’s supposed to lead to Terms and Conditions led me to the GCash Welcome/Advertisement Page. I suppose it was leading me to the little words at the bottom of page. 

I cannot adjust my Profile name without having to go through the tedious 3–Step Verification process. What gives?

The Send Money “Optional Message” malfunctions when using non–alphanumeric characters like comma (,) and apostrophe (‘).

They offer too may side services like investments, savings and charity donation tools but they can’t even fix the most basic feature of being able to cash in conveniently. How can we avail other services within this app if we can’t put in our money first? 

I am a fully verified user but eversince I installed this app, I’m unable to link my gcash to any bank account and or even cash in with other online options like using paypal or my credit/debit card. This app always has too many technical issues to begin with. Also, since I can’t link it with any bank account, withdrawing money from here is a challenge as well. And yes, you have the option of simply going to convenience stores to put money in your gcash too but it defeats the purpose of having the app. Why bother installing this when you can’t settle your basic matters through a touch of a finger?

The worst part is that the live support is totally useless and will keep asking the same questions and details that are unrelated to the issue you reported. After days of going in circles, I totally gave up talking to them. Also, I wouldn’t trust a service wherein several different staff will keep on asking for my bank account details. This is very unsecure and could impose potential privacy and security issues to the user.

2021-04-24 01:39:51,"The app boasts of its growth and tech expertise in PH, and tbh, it’s true that it is advanced. But looking at the tech landscape, GCash monopolizes the market being the only full-stack virtual wallet there. Obviously it would land the top spot. I would receive top honors too if I were the only person in the class, even if my scores were abysmal.

Pit it against international apps and it falls hella short.

Going through the experience of the app alone shows that it lacks proper UX and upkeep to provide a seamless journey per action. Wala lang talaga ibang option ang Pinoy, so they settle for this award-winning-but-really-mediocre app.

I hope GCash has a faster tat to iron out the persistent bugs, the constant crashes, the clunkiness of the overall feel, and many more. Better live up to your awards & recognitions. Numbers from 2020 speak of necessity and not the prowess of the app.

Bugs, to name a few:
1. Persistent errors in GForest - either energy not reflecting or energy stolen causes app to crash.
2. Enrolled cash in banks do not reflect from time to time. One ends up having to repeatedly enroll the same bank whenever it disappears.
3. Enrolling bills is a frikin pain. Why can’t I enroll my CCs so I can regularly pay? I can only enroll Meralco and Globe. Why?!
4. Have you ever heard of consistent autofill? In paying bills, it’s a hit or miss. Sometimes autofill works, but 80% of the time it doesn’t. If you wanna instill habit, then make it easier for the consumer.
5. Cash in amount. I’ve used GCash since 2019. Obviously I am entitled to the max daily cash in. How come lately I’m unable to do this?

I am just wondering why you guys are keep on running this app if the service is not working most of the times. Yesterday i tried to add money to my acct, went to several partners u guys have and i ended up sending the money through them instead using my app for me to save some money. However as a customer u cant do anything but to keep on murmuring how bad the app is.. it shows here in the application that we can get money over the counter through tour partners. i tried that a lot of times and keep on asking is to why they cant process it.. they will just answer me that its with GCASH on their end ur app does kot works fine and most of the time its offline..GCASH why are u doing this things to ur customers? Dont u think its a waste of time for us?? How come ur able to keep this app working and u guys doesnt even care if were able to use it or not. Tried calling a lot of times and i dont get answers from ur agents.. some of ur agents are nit familiar with the options that u guys have. Have them trained pls,,!! Now going to my issue. Now it says here under borrow load that i can borrow load and ill be deducted as soon as ill add money to my gcash acct.. now that option is still there but it does not allow me to borrow the load.. its important for me coz as of this time i need to get in touch with my family and i cant go outside to buy load coz of the curfew.i cant do it coz the community is under quarantine.. now i dont see that u guys are being helpful to us people.. pretty much i will make sure that ill report ur app and give u bad ratings and provide u comments that can awaken ur sense for u guys to check on the app itself..

2018-08-24 12:12:53,"TL;DR this is a short summary of my horrible experience with Globe’s GCASH feature and customer service team. Bottom line is DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK ALL THE TIME AND IF IT DID NOT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CALL THEIR HOTLINE AND WAIT FOR 20-30 MINS BEFORE GETTING A REP. 

I have been having issues with the GCash Card for weeks now. 

The system keeps saying no payment has been processed yet it already deducted money from my account. This happened twice when I attempted to buy credits from Grab and another when I was trying to pay for my cc bill. 

When I had the issue with my cc bill, I had no choice but to call the hotline, it was already past my due date. I had to pay a penalty fee because of it, so I was at least expecting that the bill will post after a few business days but it just consumed the money AGAIN! The rep told me, guaranteed with all his might, that the payment went thru, that it was what he saw in their system. After 3-4 days, the money went back to my GCash account. What he told me was a lie. I waited almost 30 minutes just to get a rep to talk to and my issue just resolved by itself without your company’s help. He also told me that the cause might be some sort of bug or glitch and that he already escalated it, but the bad news is he cannot tell when it will be fixed. 

I relied on GCash because I pay most of my bills here. I buy load for my friends and family here. It’s very convenient, but this fiasco has convinced me that I CANNOT RELY NOR DEPEND ON YOUR SYSTEM AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is money we’re talking about! This is the money we work hard to earn everyday, but based on your system issues, it’s clear that you are not on top of this at all which makes your system unreliable.

It has been a very frustrating and unpleasant experience. Just to add to that, my money got consumed again today. I never learn, do I? This will be the last time. I enrolled my bill payments to an alternative. I don’t want to use this service ever again.",1,Rieyuxel,False,Never Again,gcash,520020791,

I have been following up on my problem since Tuesday, December 18, 2018 and have not received any resolution from any of the Gcash support team.

On Monday, December 17, I still keep getting the same error message.

On Tuesday, December 18, I called up GCash and the agent logged in a report stating my problem of being unable to withdraw my remaining balance. When she finished her report, she gave me the reference number and told me to follow up on my problem after two (2) business days.

On Wednesday, December 19, I tried to check again using a different bank ATM. I still got the same error message 

Today, I spoke with another Gcash agent (Christian) and he typed up a new report once more.

To sum it all up, I could NOT withdraw from any ATM machine. I could NOT do cash out. I could NOT pay using QR. And I have not exceeded my monthly limit, because my total for this month is below 100K!

I have ALWAYS experienced several setbacks with GCash, and yet I continued to use it. Until now.

This is my hard-earned money which I need to withdraw from my GCash account ASAP. 

I just need my money back ASAP and the Gcash support team has been unwilling to offer help in any form. Do they really exist or are they merely a fabrication of the company?

The buy-load feature used to offer a 10% instant rebate, then reduced to 5%, then 4%, and now, they have scratchcards that give users a chance to win load vouchers, cashbacks, and QR vouchers (that are seeded to the user’s account but very delayed or are not even seeded). Worse, customer service is less responsive.

Despite all these, I will continue to use the app as it is very useful in paying bills. But I hope they will improve its features.

ii). GCash Username - Phone number is one of the most personal things that should not be shared with anyone specially a stranger on the internet. Furthermore, it would be easier and privacy-focused to give a username and receive money through it than sharing personal phone number. Something like $G.SAMPLEUSERNAME would be cool to have.

PLEASE BE AWARE OF GCash!!!!! THEY ARE GODDAMN THIEVES!!! SOBRA NA TALAGA!! 

ONCE IS ENOUGH!! TWICE IS FUCKING TOO MUCH!!

I cashed in the 10,300php from BDO. I cashed in the 4,920php from Security Bank.

Last April 3, I Cashed In 10,300php through my linked Debit Card ( BDO ) but it did not reflect sa Gcash yet  na sa account ko. I received a text saying it cannot be processed at the moment. So I waited 24 hours hoping magreflect pero wala talaga. 

I contacted Gcash Support and was told na it is unsuccessful on their end so there's nothing they can do about it. So I contacted BDO, I was advised that it is successful and I should contact Gcash to have it credited.

I contacted Gcash again and they told me the same thing which is it is unsuccessful. I told them what BDO told me and they said they will escalate it. Since then, araw araw ako natawag for an update pero laging wala hanggang sa mapagod na ako.

After 17 days of waiting, they sent me an email telling me it is really unsuccessful and I should coordinate with BDO. They said they will provide me a Formal Letter certifying that it is unsuccessful to provide sa Bank.

I submitted a dispute sa BDO but it was declined due to lack of supporting documents. Since then wala pa din yung Formal Letter na need ko. Araw araw nagsesend ako ng email. Formal letter nalang hindi pa maibigay!! 10,300php is not a joke!!

Since then, nakakapag Cash In ako ng mga small amounts para sa load. All those transactions walang issue. 

Now, I cashed in again amounting 4920php through linked Debit Card ( SecurityBank ). I got an error yet the money has been taken out of my SB account. For the second time!!! 

So pag small amounts, no issues. Pag malaking amounts, nagdidisappear!!!

Interface looked simple and easy but it’s when you use it that’s difficult. One: I got myself fully verified, the app had the label but I could still not access everything it promised — invest, save, etc. What’s worse is that I keep having to reverify myself over and over and could not get my profile updated and access the upgraded features. Two: even after multiple times of verification, even if I add my address correctly, on the profile page, it does not reflect the correct one.

Around 6pm, 2882 sent SMS that ""Sorry, your balance is insufficient to complete the transaction."" Even I'm not using the card! It's on my desk, I panicked (ofcourse). 

Apparently, my newly linked GCash MasterCard was easily skimmed while in my purse, (thru NFC or RFID by sophisticated hackers) I'm just shopping for holiday gifts. 

It's like someone wanted to do Unauthorized Transaction because GCash also works as prepaid debit/credit card. 

[Cover all you want, but these hackers are getting advanced as well; they can scan thru your wallet or bag with their stealth apparatus. Especially this holiday season. Easy online shopping for them, ha!]

I thought, the security of GCash MasterCard has strengthened since it's valid until 2027. NOPE.

Yet, 2882 SMS warned me that someone's trying to hack into it, but failed due to only P4.00 balance. 

What if... about P4,000.00 or 40,000.00 in my GCash wallet? Will OTP even work? Will GCash trace the hacker & give my money back? NOPE. Then, I'm probably broke this Holiday season! 

Good thing, I transferred my funds to another bank.

2019-02-01 02:21:59,"They claim that it is convenient to use their pay bills services. But my experience had been very stressful.

They have deducted two times from my account when I tried to use their pay bills service amounting P5350. I was deducted P10700! I called immediately to reverse back my money. I called 2882 but there is no option to talk to an agent. So I called 211 and had to ask them to transfer my call to their GCash department.

The first agent I talked to told me that there will be 3-5 working days turn around time for the to reverse the second deduction. (Take note, it was their system’s fault that I have been deducted twice, and I will have to wait that long!?!)

I followed up 3 working days after, the agent told me to wait until 5th working days and follow up again.

I called again on the 5th working day. I was very angry. I have waited 1 hour on queue plus the 1 week turn around time they told me but their answer was to wait for another 24 hours. I insisted that they resolve my issue right away so the agent put me on hold for another 30 FREAKING MINUTES THEN DROPPED THE CALL!

I called again and waited for another hour on queue. I asked the agent to transfer my call to a supervisor and waited another 30 minutes before the call was tranfered. They say that they are contacting their support team which were very unresponsive. Only then that I receive an email that I have to send some documents for them to do the reversal. WHAT HAPPEND TO THE 3-5 WORKING DAYS TURN AROUND TIME? They did nothing!!! I have to be very furious for them to take actions!

I have been on the call with the supervisor for more than 1 hour but nothing happened, her only response was that the support team is still waiting for the response of the support from the third party. The supervisor promised to call the next day to update me of the progress.

The hours had passed and I didn’t receive any call. So I called AGAIN and waited AGAIN another hour on queue. The agent I talked to told me that they are still for their support team’s response. I said I will not end the call until they resolve my issue. I was literally on call for 8 hours! The call had been dropped a few times having reached the 2 hours limit.

Their final response is that I would have contact the biller ang fix the issue myself (WHICH WAS THEIR SYSTEM’S FAULT) or I would have to wait 1-2 FREAKING MONTHS for them to return my money. I freaked out! WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THEIR MISTAKE? WHY WON’T THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY? It is hard-earned money we are talking about. P5350 may be small amount for some of you but it is a VERY BIG DEAL to me. I could accept their answer so I asked to be tranfered to a supervisor.

The supervisor just said that, ‘That’s all, that’s that. We can no longer offer any more help.’ Asked him to transfer me ro someone with higher position who help resolve my issue but he insisted that there is noone.

WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT?!

I t maybe veiwed as advanced payment to my biller but that was way out of budget! For someone like me who every cents counts, it would be a big loss. The physical and emotional stressed this experience had caused me was WAS WAY MORE damaging.
