It is starting to become pretty annoying,2018-12-29 15:24:59,3,Fhayerie0406,False,"Almost everything is smooth except for three things that i had experienced; the first one was i purchase a load amounting to 100 i received a text message that it was an error but gcash deducted the 100 on my balance and it never returned next i was trying to pay my electric bill through pelco2 and i keep on getting an error of invalid account number wherein last month my transaction went smoothly with the same company and lastly i was trying to cashin my remittance through moneygram and the only options are to provide the amount and the control number i did that and was getting a pop up stating that i need to provide the sender name and receiver name but there is no option for me to type that hence, i tried it again same error and on the fourth attempt i receive a pop up error stating that the control number is wrong and that my account specific to the cashin through remittance is locked out due to mulitple invalid attempts like what the heck. Tried to call 2882 and it is totally useless contacted the gcash care and there is still no respond. I hope there could be a person that i can easily talked to with the issues that is going through with the app and my activities through it.",gcash,520020791,
Actually ok.,2020-05-16 07:33:32,5,i don't usually rate/review,False,"This app gets so many negative reviews but it’s actually not that bad. It’s really made things more convenient. I get to avoid long lines especially in banks, since you can deposit using this app. You just have to go cash in through machines and other partner establishments which have no lines usually. It has also been a great help during the quarantine. Also there’s no convenience fee when paying bills when using their service unlike other apps where they charge you for it. I did encounter times where deductions to my fund were made despite transactions failing but i contacted customer service and filed a form and was refunded (just provide proof and you’re good). There was also one time where I cashed in to a wrong account (I typed a wrong number) with 15k and called the customer service and they were able to transfer it back to my correct account (again just provide proof like transaction numbers and receipts and you’re good). Yeah those took some time but it’s typical in our country to have slow processing when it comes to these things so it was understandable. I also like the plant a tree thing they have in the app.",gcash,520020791,
Cash In Concern,2020-02-04 00:25:57,3,Mhei Castro,False,"A little bit disappointed when I cashed in via debit card. I waited 3-5mins to receive the OTP, I had to restart the application but still same scenario happened. When I checked my account, I was already credited by my bank and so I reached for customer support since it was not funded in my Gcash account, the first one I talked to said that they had no transactions so I need to call my issuing bank. I called them and said that if it was already deducted on my account meaning it was a successful transaction and I need to talk to Gcash. So, I tried reaching out to GCash customer support but still no update on my concern.

This was always a concern to me whenever I cash in via debit card, the OTP is always late. I hope you can fix this, I've been using Gcash for quite a while now. I need my money cause that's my only cash. If only I knew this would happen, I wouldn't put my cash on gcash and paid my bill somewhere else.",gcash,520020791,
Frustrating and slow and you’re a bunch of thieves,2019-12-10 09:43:52,1,gella.fish,False,"I’ve been an avid gcash user for almost 3 years, and every day I always make purchases through this app. However, these past few days especially within this month, my payment method was continuously declined even though I never had any problems before. Every time I tried verifying my information, the money taken out for the verification was never returned to my account (there should always be a reversal for this kind of process). I have done this several times today and spent more than Php200 just for verification of my card and it still won’t go through despite correct information.

What’s worst is that a few days ago I purchased an item however iTunes wasn’t available, so obviously the transaction would be unsuccessful right? However, money was deducted from my account and never returned! I sent a ticket, contact customer service via mail and number and even messaged them on messenger...no response!

I contacted Apple and they have great and fast customer service. Meanwhile your app steals money from their own customers. I’m gonna cancel my account and report this to the authorities because this is not right. You should not have a slow and frustrating service especially when it comes to people’s money.",gcash,520020791,
Payments don’t post.,2018-06-26 18:43:31,1,7h3n6,False,"My payment via gcash did not post. It takes 3-5bd for the support team receive the report ticket submitted by the cust rep. It takes another 2bd to get result from the support team. Despite the payment was made 3weeks before. They don’t even make sure that the payment you made would go through. They would not even reach out to you to update you. So the money is not posted to the recipient, not even in the float, not in your gcash account since they already deducted it; but in their account. So they are using your money for themselves for as long as possible. It’s been months and still no development. Custrep are useless as they can only submit tickets to their support team. Their support team does not do it’s job, and they are untouchable. No sense of ownership. You can’t ask them a take action and they don’t follow their own 2-3bd turn around time. All they say is that they are waiting for a feedback, even if it’s already 2months and nothing was ever received yet. So whether it takes a year to get a feedback, if they will ever get one, or not. And their management is the same, they don’t have process in place to make sure that good service is provided and incompetent personnels/departments are called out.",gcash,520020791,
Forgotten MPIN 👎,2019-08-11 06:45:05,1,Shiria_Milka,False,"Once you forgot your MPIN, you have a very slow service when resolving it, it took me 6days to have a proper response on Gmail, 2 accounts on messenger. They have long list of requirements for you to fill in order to retrieve it, but then after you fill it all they’ll response after Few days. The response isn’t the answer you’ll expect, but it’ll ask for more information, and yet up until this 6th day I still haven’t retrieve my account. 👎 the verification sent by gcash from the app for MPIN, will say i have entered the right pin but i will have to contact it through gmail and messenger, after i contact it the account on messenger will direct you to another gcash account for more info, and after i reached out on these three accounts up until now they still request for more, but the same requirements. Looks like they don’t focus on my response they just focus on relying the same even though i sent it already. It’s so hard to retrieve it when in facebook your forgotten password will be retrieve in less than 5minutes if you still have your gmail. Sorry but i’ll spread these to different social medias, and those people i know. Hoping for better improvement",gcash,520020791,
Gcash user since 2018,2020-06-07 04:57:17,5,Kyo V,False,"I've been using gcash for 2 years now, and yes it's not perfect, but it has helped me a lot in managing my finances, especially now that there's a pandemic and you just can't go out whenever you want to. It made transfers between different banks easier. I'm able to pay my bills at home. Connecting my bank account to gcash and cashing in and out happens real time. Although I've encountered some issues like unsuccessful transaction and yet money is deducted from my account, or errors in paying bills I'm usually paying every month, I still believe these are just minor lapses which Gcash will be able to address (in my case, money deducted was returned, and I'm able to pay the bill by retrying several times). Not to mention Gsave (partnered with CIMB) which has a 4.1% per annum interest rate, which is WAAAAY above what banks offer.

So as a summary, I still believe Gcash is a great app to use. Go ahead and download it!",gcash,520020791,
GCash is Losing its Prime,2020-04-26 04:57:47,1,BalaGad0om,False,"Okay GCash dati 3-4 years ago. Ngayon puro errors na, kahit fully verified ka magkakaroon ng errors like transaction limit kahit di ka nakakapag GCash transaction that day. Pinaganda lang UI pero pinasakit ulo mo. Ngayon pinag iisipan ko nang ilipat yung GSave funds ko sa iba. Yung hassle na binibigay sayo ng app na to sobrang nakaka stress na dapat eh simple lang sana which is yun ang purpose nila. 

Since 2018 my main source of incoming funds ay thru PayPal. Sobrang dali noon. Walang hassle. Thankful ako sa GCash. But last month, hindi na ako makapag cash in sa PayPal. Puro error na lang yung App. Lahat ng trouble shootings ginawa ko na. Lahat ng suggestions ng GCash Support walang kwenta dahil hindi naman na resolve yung issue. Asked customer service ng PayPal. Wala naman daw problema account ko. So ano na? Weeks pasts wala pa rin talaga.

So I decided na mag cash in using my bank accounts. Okay naman nung una pero may mga kailngan akong transaction using bank transfer sa GCash at ngayon hindi makapag proceed. May error na naman like limits etc. for the limit, I cash in small amount and have to transfer it to my parent para may pang gastos at pambili ng makakakain. Convenient sana kase easy transfer na, lockdown pa naman. Pero nakaka stress I cash in small amount which is wala pang 10% ng daily transaction limit ko at ngayon hindi ako makapag padala.",gcash,520020791,
Read please!!,2021-01-12 09:46:26,5,Monica cheekee,False,"Those others who doesn’t like gcash don’t expect to much of gcash because not everything u want can give it. To those others who have an error maybe give a little more patience, think of it as the time is giving u a challenge like if u can give more patience or not, you just really need time and maybe try to solve what’s the problem first before you dramatically go crazy. Anyways other than that base on my experience, I just don’t get why people don’t realize that we are all hurting but nobody cares, at all maybe at least try to solve your problems with those people close to you and don’t make up things that’s not even true from the start the girl is hurting and not only for girls but for boys as well and again other than the things I just said right now I’m happy of using the gcash that’s all bye anyways sorry for telling my feelings I just can’t take it anymore",gcash,520020791,
Delayed Payment Reflection,2020-07-16 05:22:48,2,Jem Ang,False,"GCash serves as a really convenient way to purchase and settle bill. My first ever transaction this June 2020 to settle my Globe postpaid account (same mother company) has been neglected countless times and remains unresolved up to now though. My line was actually cut for four (4) days due to this unreflected payment. 

I have resorted to the Globe hotline 211 which does not provide any AI option to address this. Globe store asked me to take this up with G-cash through their 2882 hotline. G-cash hotline and online were quite helpful to confirm that payment has already been reflected on the system of G-Cash, but my Globe One account does not state the same. Now G-Cash wants me to coordinate back with Globe. Both are pointing fingers at each other. Three weeks have passed and still no solution from either G-Cash nor Globe!

One thing I know is when my billing due date arrives again, neither of these two (2)  companies will have their services cut because of an “unapplied” and “unreflected” payment already made.",gcash,520020791,
Buggy App. Return my money ASAP,2019-10-01 19:20:41,1,Maweese,False,"There’s still a lot of things that they need to fix at the back end. I’m not sure if I’ll get my money back. I cashed in 21,500 from my Metrobank account, I received confirmation from my bank that the payment went through, but said amount has yet to reflect on my Gcash account. If you try creating a ticket (through their helpline) you will only get an automated response. Calling their hotline is a nightmare since representatives are apathetic and the person whom I spoke with claimed that the issue with cash in’s is solely isolated with BPI - despite the fact that numerous complaints were received by Metrobank customers that their cash ins did not reflect on their Gcash account. To cap it all of, investigation/ response will take approximately 3-5 business days which means that I am already late in my payments. I spent approximately 4-5 hours trying to get this issue fixed only to get a response that is equivalent to maybe you’ll get your money back. Gcash is giving Globe a bad name. You need to fix your App and your customer service.",gcash,520020791,
Awful experience,2020-02-10 15:45:41,1,polite citizen,False,"This is the worst experience I had with gcash! I tried to cash in from mypaypal account which I usually do twice a month! When I tried it today it says the app needs updating but when I tried ti update it says the app is updated. What the heck is happening to your system. You’re saying that you are better than any other app but this happens. I tried contacting gcash support but to no luck, it feels like I was talking to a robot that kept on asking me the same question. I understand that sometimes there will be a system error but the thing is, your supports are so bad to the point that I was only asking a simple question but kept on asking me details about the issue that I had which I already explain to them whats wrong. They should stop using script! After giving what they need they would say they will forward it to the higher support and we need to wait. Is this the service you give to the customer?! Not even an apology from your customer support! If this issue happens again I will stop using GCash!",gcash,520020791,
Best Finance App!,2020-04-21 09:25:07,4,Angkas Lover Ugh,False,"GCash is a big help, indeed. I’ve been using using this app since 2017 and it really helped me to be more financially literate for it has a lot of features that will enable youth professionals to efficiently manage their finances. 

Some of the best features include:
- It allows you to buy load and earn rebates! 
- Upon registering to promo, you can earn coupons which you can use on scan to pay features
- allows you to save with high interest, and invest too! 
- easily transfer funds to bank with real-time posting and no extra fees! 
- Scan to pay is very useful
- Secured and convenient e-wallet
- Wide-range of coverage, a lot of establishments are using GCash already!
- You can help nature by just loading or walking! 
- Smooth application

Why 4 star not 5 then? 
I think there is a need for the following upgrades: 

1. GCredit
Allow users to pay it in installment. Like for 5,000 they can choose of to pay it within 3 to 5 months. 

Include card for GCredit

2. Customer Service
You know what to do. Customer service is really 1/5, honestly. 

3. User interface and security
Allow users to log in using only fingerprint. 

4. Partner Establishments
Some cashiers don’t know how to transact using GCash pushing some establishments not to offer it to customers

5. Vouchers
Vouchers must be universal.",gcash,520020791,
Good start poor finish,2020-01-23 02:15:33,2,badbishop184,False,"Application works pretty okay at the beginning but gradually locks you out of online purchases over time. Oddly enough, help or customer service is not integrated into the app. Customer service reps refuse to coordinate with third party vendors who don't accept the transaction even when you show the apps history and the vendors instructions. They also just close tickets for no reason which you have to reopen under a new ticket, and they never read the history even when you ask them to. You can still get billed in GCash even when the transaction doesn't push through; in my case I got billed 4x the amount I initially made a purchase for. The app doesn't have settings to enable online purchases or check what your card can do and not do. AMEX and PayPal linking are poorly integrated and unintuitive. 2FA is a nice touch, but sometimes the process is interrupted by random pop-ups mid transaction.",gcash,520020791,

I have just started the verification process, said “Update Progress”.. in almost a YEAR. The 48-72 hr timeframe stretched out for months. I did this last year, and their Customer Service in GcashCare suggested a lot of things that I already did, they can’t even cancel my pending verification so I could re-start. This has taken MONTHS. They literally take WEEKS to respond to you. Loads of sent screenshots later, they told me I needed to upgrade the app because they’re seeing that my app needs upgrading WHEN I JUST DID THAT THREE DAYS PRIOR. So I now have a new number, tried to get verified again, and surprise I got verified in 5minutes flat. Think they got better? Think again. I cashed in through 711 because their barcode was down, got the confirmation msg from 711 that it was successful BUT IT WAS NEVER DEPOSITED INTO MY GCASH ACCT.

This app has brought great convenience to me since I started using it. I am a PWD and while I get privileges of avoiding long lines, there’s still the hassle of commute when I go out to, say pay my bills or claim my remittance. With GCash, I just pull out my phone, tap on my Gcash then I can do my errands right in my room. You could just imagine the time, the money that I have saved since I got the app. So thank you.

7 years and counting,2021-02-17 09:15:31,5,Yanie97,False,"Been using gcash for 7 years and I can say it did improved over time. One of my concern is the user interface. Too much is going on. And as time goes by, gcash has more buttons being added. Would prefer if it’s only cash in, cash out, send money, save money, pay bills, g forest and buy load. Would also appreciate if we can withdraw our gcredit since not all establishments accepts gcash payments. Plus my gcash mastercard always get declined when i pay using pos eventhough i have more than enough money on my wallet. I unlinked my mastercard already coz nakakahiya everytime nadedecline ang card kahit may laman naman.  It would be better if gcash produces another set of cards just for gcredit use only.

So, I immediately called the customer service on June 30, 2020, about the issue and asked me to create a new Gcash account because they will send there my balance on my previous account. They asked for all the details they needed through email and sent it to them immediately. After 2 days (July 2) I received an email from them that the amount was already sent on my new account they sent a reference number with date, I already told them that I didn’t receive either the money or the reference number. I immediately called the customer service and keep calling them, up until now (July 6) the same answer I am getting from them. What the Heck, Gcash!!

GCASH STOLE MY MONEY,2019-12-10 11:08:22,1,therantothea,False,"I had money in my investment feature, and then out of the blue I was downgraded to a basic account, locking me out of the investment feature. I tried reverifying the account, but every time I pressed the “get fully verified” button, the app would crash. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app four times, restarted my phone twice, updated my phone’s iOS, and nothing. Can’t reverify. So I contacted GCash “Help” and their decidedly unhelpful suggestions ranged from “updating my email” (which you can’t do without having an already verified account, by the way) to “verifying the app”. Yeah. Completely useless.  Then I went to the Globe store to verify the account from there, and guess what? I couldn’t. Who else thinks this is stupid? To have no way for a customer to get there account verified especially when there is money in the account. 
Anyway, I even contacted GCash Invest to see if I could get the money out directly and they couldn’t help out either. So. In short.

My bank (HSBC), is not one of the banks that has direct communication with GCash, but I was able to cash in via the Mastercard/Visa option. Now they removed it. Since HSBC online does not support GCash, I need to physically withdraw money, and cash in via over the counter. This is a shame because of the current pandemic, I want to stay away from people as much as possible. Now it’s two crowded areas I have to go to. Another thing, 7-11’s cash in is a confusing robbery! I did two transactions, because they only allowed up to 10k for a transaction. The 10k cost 60PHP but the 9.1k transaction was 180PHP! What?! 

One more, I linked it with my App Store. I bought an in game product, got deducted, but nothing was credited to my account. I contacted the ticket desk, but there has been no reply except for an automated thank you note.

I would also like to ask how the rebate works?

Customer care inconvenient to use,2020-06-07 09:31:21,1,Jade041812,False,"Gcash has been very helpful in many ways to me. Most transactions are smooth. However, in times of issues or concerns, it takes forever to resolve the issue and the customer support chat is annoying. First, you contact them and inform your concern, then when you get ahold of them, they will ask you to fill up more forms. There was this instance that i am contacting them for a 15 pesos load that i didn’t receive, and i had to answer 2 forms! 1 for the info and one for dispute form. I mean seriously??? It’s time wasting specially if you are just asking for the refund of a 15 pesos deduction. I would understand if it was a big amount, but for small bills, Customer support should be able to do it on their end without so much hassle. Unless Globe does not trust their own people. Then I suggest you get people you trust. I’m leaving my review to 1 star unless I see that the customer support and Gcash resolution is improved.",gcash,520020791,
Improvement Suggestions,2020-06-28 02:58:24,4,regsville,False,"1. When a biller is saved, the information is deleted either when a new user logs-in to the app (via switch user / change logged-in mobile #), OR during the next app update is released. The info should be saved per user profile so the information is still available anywhere (roaming) the user logs-in.
2. Biller account #s such as in a Meralco Ref# should have separators (i.e. dash) on the confirmation page for readability. This is burdensome and is prone to typo/human error when paying such bills with long account numbers.

So I loaded his number, but what happened is that my balance got deducted and my friend didn’t even received his load. I tried contacting GCash Care again but they are still unresponsive. I really hope they have a number which you could call when you have this kind of problems. I’ve been using GCash for almost a year now I really liked it at first bet ever since I run into trouble and they don’t even have a good support makes me wanna switch to other another app.",gcash,520020791,

Sent multiple messages to Gcash care. Do you really care? I guess not. You marked my concern as solved with a nonexistent transaction id and without even confirming with me if the issue has been solved. BSP should reconsider trusting you to hold people's money.

Another issue is with regards to the autopay to unknown merchants like COMIC RELIEF and FLUENTU.

First, I used Gcash because I have a job that pays through Paypal and since it is more convenient to encash using Gcash via Paypal. What if we need the money as soon as possible and because of that system everything was delayed. If this will still happen I'd rather encash paypal to my bank account directly and wait for 3 days to get the money than to use Gcash and be afraid of doing transactions as it may fail again.

Problems I am experiencing with the app,2020-07-17 01:05:54,2,CarloHofilena,False,"Hi Gcash Developers,
This is a good app for cashless transactions but still has a lot to improve. Here are the problems I am experiencing 
1. When I link my BPI account here, it’s weird that it won’t take the password for my BPI app, I ended changing my password in BPI for 6 times. It always show that the password is wrong so the BPI app blocked my account and password needed to be changed.

2. Transaction History - I think it would be great if the transaction history shows the receipt generated after the transaction and by the way, sending the transaction history to my email is not working

3. In addition to the transactiob history, when I export/save the transaction receipt to my phone, it is cut off in the middle. I don’t know why but yes it is cut off right in the middle.

4. Some fields aren’t working - I am saving BIR as a biller, but when I tap on “preferred biller name” it is not working. Hence I cannot save this biller and I have to go through the usual process when I pay bills. 

I hope these bugs in the app can be addressed. It’s a financial app and highly utilized, money is being handled so it has to be really working efficiently.

Ok fine. I dealt with that.

What’s really annoying to me though is that you even have the guts to not shoulder the data for the customers. Using the app should be in free data mode IMO. It becomes very useless in situations where you have cash in your wallet but unable to use it because you suddenly ran out of data. If you really want to make this app a replacement for real money at least do that for your customers. I would not like to use a virtual wallet app that I suddenly cannot use. That’s too unreliable.

MAKING LIFE EASIER WITH GCASH,2019-09-04 15:37:45,5,iPhone6s +,False,"If you buy food, shop clothes, do the groceries, pay bills, send, invest or save money, buy or sell load, then this app is really for you especially if you do enjoy discounts and promos.

I really love going to shopping malls and checking out new clothes or eating out with friends. I do this almost twice or thrice a week with Family, Friends or Co-workers.

When I started using GCASH, everything seems to be getting easier. Paying your food bill with just a scan, purchasing your new OOTD and more... But, what I love the most is that they always give back to their users. I, personally, get a lot of vouchers, discounts from stores, promos from food purchases and even money back with bills payment.

Truly, GCASH is money and life saver. I remember one time when I left the house and forgot my wallet. Good thing I have GCASH, I easily used it to pay for what I eat. I’m saved!!

Their CS agents are so lazy and don't even read properly your concerns. They just send you responses which are obviously taken out from a template. I know this because their responses to me are too far from the actual concern. They just send out generic replies maybe so that it can be said that they responded.

Always doing service maintenance,2020-04-23 13:08:36,2,MahalinMoAko,False,"I like GCash because it is very convenient and helpful. 

What I only don’t like about GCash, probably for us users, is that it made our lives disappointed when we badly need GCash for load and other online transactions.

GCash is usually doing a service maintenance that affects the entire GCash system.

I don’t know with GCash, but I suggest if they intend to update or correct their server development, it should be on their beta. It is not good that it damages the entire system, other transactions, withdrawal, cash-ins, bills, and many more - where people expect it to be used in needs of emergency.

We cannot load our mobile data and pay bills and stuffs because it’s almost everyday or every week that they do maintenance affecting the whole Gcash App.

Please GCash do something good on this.

I trusted this app because it is legitimately be trusted. But I badly do not like how you made some customers create a bad impression.

I hope this concern has been heard and noted.

Ironic for an online wallet,2018-11-16 06:20:21,1,Hindiakogalet,False,"I thought Gcash was supposed to make things more convenient, but transacting with them is the exact opposite of that.

I talked to Meralco and they told me they only accept Visa, Mastercard & JCB. Funny enough, Gcash’s virtual card is supported by Amex. If I wanted to pay my bills with Gcash online, I’d have to avail their physical card.

What’s up with that? If that’s how you want to do things at least give a notice or disable the actions that are not amenable for online card users. Now I can’t cash out because the system is still down.",gcash,520020791,

Let’s start with a problem I have...
It is been a 4 months that I can not link my Paypal to my Gcash because of credentials (credentials means first name middle name last name must be matched)
So there is a (N/A) in my middle name on gcash which Paypal does not accept . I talked with many people, many agents, many teams.... and they are way too UNPROFESSIONAL! 
How difficult is it to delete a middle name?
They are just trolling me by asking many many many questions and transferring me to the next team!
Yes! To the next team and the cycle starts again! 

They asked many personal and high security questions and requirements such as signature and selfie and every single ID you have.
And then after that, NOTHING!
Although I should mention to all you people that Gcash is Irresponsible for any of your problems. Understand?! If you lost your money inside. That’s gone.... if you can not transfer... it’s gone.... and if you are thinking to withdraw from Gcash card. It has 50PHP interest.

What feature I would like to be added is the ability to save account numbers for billers so users won’t have to type them every time (some users like me have the habit to recheck what we type over and over just to make sure)

The app is good and served its purpose.

I got locked out of the app because I forgot my MPIN. The security questions when you forget your MPIN are totally ridiculous that it’s almost impossible to recover your account. Once this happens, you are locked out for 24 hours before you can try again. GCash, why are you making things so inconvenient for users?
Cash-in function through online banking does not work at all. Be careful as you may not receive the money in your GCash wallet. Credit card linking is not working as well. Gcash is not useful at all. GCash e-mail support is equally unhelpful. Provides totally useless answers. Not worthwhile to download GCash. Stay away from this app.",gcash,520020791,

Other option: PAY MAYA

PROS: The app is really good and I give it a 9/10.
It’s very easy to use and very convenient when making deposits to other banks from your GCASH with ZERO FEES!

CONS: Customer Service Reps are really stupid and have no common sense! I have issues which until now are still not resolved. They just copy paste their reply everytime you ask them for assistance.  I asked for help via hotline, messenger and email but still NOTHING!  When you ask for their supervisor they never take the  call.  Why does gcash keep hiring incompetent call center agents? 

Customer Service 1/10
Logic 1/10
Robot Behavior 10/10 
Security 0/10
Verification Process: 0/10
Modification of Information 0/10

The APP is really great but somehow you would just give it up when you have issues and transfer  to PAY MAYA because the customer service is HELL!  Not a single agent was able to resolve the issue.

i will not dispute something since iTunes issued a refund. So the issue is with gcash not willing to issue a refund after all.

Making transactions fast but Failing during midmonth and month-ends,2020-01-30 03:27:26,3,modernsopher,False,"Bank-gcash-another bank transaction has never been this convenient. As well as payment and reloading. Inconvenience happens when transactions are made during 14th-15th and 29th-30th of the month maybe due to high volume of users.

It took a very long time after they answer my concerns about using this app and they just get all of your personal information and after a while, still you don’t have the actions you want to be resolved. They just keep on getting the information of the users just like what you will see on their Facebook pages (a lot of Facebook pages).

Tying an account to a Mobile number is ridiculous. There should be an option to change the mobile number associated with the account as there are a lot of cases that would need one.

They made an app to make it look more convenient.

They also used the messenger to do transactions for gcash which is good and only good if you have an internet. 

But what if you ran out of data? How are you suppose to get the rebate out of using the app or messenger?

I loved Gcash so much before..

If you're gonna ask me how do I think about this app now, I don't know if its still essential to keep it.

A feature I would like to see in the app is the option to store/save the receipt (the one u see after every transaction whether sending money or paying via Q.R.) on the phone.  And the ability to erase them later on.

It's all about manual account verification and I have requested if your CSR can do it since it doesn't allow me to verify my account. I have sent all of the documents that they need and informing me thru email it's still not acceptable? I thought you want to gain customer to use your application.

I linked my gcash MasterCard to my account and until now it is not showing in the App as linked. I know that it is linked because I am using the card for shopping. Almost half of the app content is just link that will redirect you to their website. (What is the point of making an app?)

Globe has the sh**tiest signal. Won’t allow me to transact even I have 2 out of four bars of LTE. Wasted my time last time I went to the mall. If you are a PayMaya user you will notice a BIIIGGGG DIFFERENCE. Globe needs to hire better IT Team.

2. Bank deposits - no longer have to line up in banks just to transfer/deposit

4. Load - purchase load with rebate!

I obviously didn’t care about those small amount of transactions because I just want my 20,000 pesos back. I’m currently seeking legal help against GCash.

Well, in some point, I was able to make transactions smoothly. Hoping that with this updated app things will run smoothly.",gcash,520020791,
No direct customer service contact number,2019-06-26 03:12:40,2,twigsShine,False,Gcash is very convenient in a way however there is no direct contact number to call support specially if there are issues on sending money (that was already deducted to the fund but was not credited to recipient’s account). They do have gcash cs thru messenger but it take like forever for them to get back to you and most of time are not resolved. This is very unacceptable specially of there is money involved...!,gcash,520020791,
Not getting my ₱50 when referring people. Can’t load via 7-11z,2019-05-09 12:53:59,1,Michael Casipit,False,I’ve referred 4 people on messenger and it’s been almost two weeks yet I haven’t received a single peso. I’m starting to think the referral program is a scam. Gonna switch to paymaya if I don’t get the money within the month. Paymaya is much better. You can easily load your account at 7-11 and is always working unlike gcash which you can’t load via 7-11 cause it’s “under maintenance” for more than a month.,gcash,520020791,
Horrible Customer Service,2019-05-09 00:42:16,1,jumanjiplayer69,False,"When you lose a card and have to unlink it, you cannot unlink it it using the app or the website. You have to contact their customer service which is horrible because they reply 2 days after you message them and then if you don’t reply for 20 minutes, they send you a message that they haven't received your message and that if you don’t reply for 24 hours then your inquiry will be cancelled.",gcash,520020791,
Limit Indicator,2020-02-27 02:51:24,3,ダイアンスー,False,"I hope you find time to include a limit progress bar of sorts so that we can track whether we've already reach the daily, or monthly limit for transactions.

I don’t understand why funds were deducted if the purchase was unsuccessful.

Not seeing any as of now issue but...,2017-09-24 21:10:44,4,RikkiAnne,False,"Not here to make comment but a suggestion. Maybe you can consider any debit/credit card (provided that it's mastercard, visa etc) as a way of reloading GCash. That way when people transact online, they won't be using their personal cards directly. Kudos to globe for finding ways to innovate. 😊",gcash,520020791,

Con artist, you better use another app for paying online coz Gcash has no care for customers, if i could report this to app store i would, not worth trusting your money you better off using paymaya or other form mode of payment.

Never ever again would i make Gcash my go to when paying online, they deserve to be taken down.",gcash,520020791,
No Refunds,2020-04-25 05:29:02,2,Isko999,False,"I like this application but the only problem is that they do refund your money. GCash steals your money even if you explain to them what happened. 

I sent Php 1k to someone thru “Express Send” since the recepient is not a GCash user. He was supposed to withdraw the money thru a partner Pawnshop but it was hard to get the money considering several requirements they are asking. 

I asked GCash Customer Support to instead refund me and i will just send my friend the money thru GCash to bank. Customer Support even called me and made me to send them some requirements before the supposed refund.

Until now, the stolen money GCash got frim me was never returned despite my several messages to GCash Customer Support. Not even a word was heard from them.",gcash,520020791,

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!,2018-12-06 17:20:25,1,Geegee0607,False,If ever you have some issues going on with your Gcash... the hotline number cannot be reach. You’ll have to contact them through Facebook Gcash support which does not respond to your concerns accordingly. I just lost money due to an issue with the app and I couldn’t connect with anyone to fix the problem.

I just hope that they'll soon focus on resolving the issues that this app has and not just keep on adding additional features.

Gcash may not be that be as reliable as we want it to be in terms of systems but it is yet unparalleled in terms of convenience and effectivity.

If you have a BPI account linked to pay everything (if not all) your bills, this is the way to go. The best feature is the payments and transfers to different banks. This is effective in terms of time and convenience in not going physically to the bank and queue in lines.

Too many issues/Customer Service unhelpful,2020-02-15 11:35:03,1,aaarkeyy,False,"Thought this was a great app until I had these issues:
1. PayQR has become scary as the confirmation sms would take time thus you will have to wait for several minutes up to an hour just to complete the transaction because there’s no way you’d want to pay again in cash when your gcash money has been deducted already. Now I don’t trust this app for payment anymore as I’m scared I would be in a rush and then have this encounter. That would be such a shame when the entire point of using this feature is because of the fast transaction.
2. Buy Load is always unavailable. Sometimes I need to buy load right away but I couldn’t because that feature is not available. Also, there’s this GoExtra90 something (not really sure of the name) that promises a 50 pesos voucher but when you try to claim it you would always get an error. I mean for what I’m paying I think the voucher is really excessive as a benefit but if the customer cannot claim it that’s false advertising and it shouldn’t be up in the promo description. Not really mad that I cannot claim it but would just want to say it shouldn’t be included in there if it really isn’t available.
3. They say you can pay Netflix through Gcash AMEX but when I try to set it up Netflix doesn’t accept it. When I contacted them they said my AMEX is not valid then I reached out to Gcash and the rep told me there should be no problem with it. When I tried to ask for how I can fix it I got no more response and I just told myself to wait but then it took ten more minutes so I just gave up. Now I don’t even know which one of them is saying the correct thing.

More Vision Than Execution,2017-12-24 09:57:32,3,GlacialGoddess,False,"This app is an example of how a great idea is ultimately rendered subpar when met with execution that leaves a lot to be desired. While there are attempts to improve, they end up falling short of ensuring the app is even the basic package it should be.

1. Support is, as expected, elusive. It's the ironic standard of Philippine telecommunication companies to ignore customers indefinitely whenever possible. I remember contacting support via email about 7 months ago since it was suggested by the official site the app page links to. Multiple months and follow-ups later, I still haven't received a response to this date.

2. Fingerprint authentication for applicable devices is missing. One can then only wonder when Face ID will be supported.

3. Transaction details pitifully pop up as your regular modal. Please have a proper screen for this where said information can be copied easily and viewed aesthetically.

4. SSS payments aren't supported. You'll be asked to use USSD. Other government institutions are being added but porting this one doesn't seem to be a priority in the slightest for some unknown reason.

5. BIR payments make the app crash. It turns out said service isn't working and this is without any advisory to both customers and apparently even the BIR. I'm not sure whether the latest version has sorted it out, but I'm not betting on it.

I got a prepaid SIM solely for GCash and I don't have the intention of switching networks; I simply want to use GCash as it is but not Globe. I was under the misguided impression that GCash was headed towards becoming an independent payment solution like PayMaya, but it appears it will unfortunately continue to just be a service under Globe and nothing more.",gcash,520020791,

Great app!,2020-01-31 10:29:02,2,killerbride,False,"Convenience at your fingertips! I saved lots of timed and money because of this app. Very convenient, practical, innovative and aesthetic. 

Almost a 5-star, it’s just that I feel conscious using it in public because of the big keys for MPIN which your neighbor can easily see. I hope you introduce a touch ID option+PIN(diff from mpin) like BDO’s so I can login using my fingerprint and a different pin in public too. 

I also wish sessions expire faster or more intuitively. I find out that sometimes, I leave the app only to go back and see I can still login and transact.

Favorite app for a while, until I reached my transaction limit! It’s my most hated app right now.

Disappointed that you don’t have a Transaction Limit tracker or warning 10k before the limit is reached. I can’t buy load, transfer to my gsave, shop online, pay merchants through the app. The app basically just became USELESS and a hassle (oh the opportunity cost of having 10k just lying there w/o interest) after I reached the transaction limit.

I have about 10k just sitting in my wallet (not even in my Gsave!!!), basically dead and not earning interest, because I reached my transaction limit for the month. 

I really hoped I was informed of my limit or accumulated transactions for each 10k mark.

I would really appreciate it if we’d have a tracker bar for transactions (transaction history is not enough since you have to have everything emailed to see all transactions for the month).

GCASH APP NEEDS SERIOUS UPDATE,2020-10-14 06:53:38,2,The Real Templar,False,"I heard a lot of bad reviews for this app. Made me want to rethink my decision to use it. I plan to use GCash to pay for my App Store since Apple is no longer downloading any Free apps without credit info. I was just at the registration page when I already encountered something ridiculous. You see, my name has a hyphen, like “John–Henry”. Of course under the given name field I’ll type “John–Henry”. But the developer decided the special character is illegal. So I’m forced to type “John Henry” which is not the same. It infuriates me when software does this to me. It infuriates me more when the developer should know better. This was probably a foretaste of the disappointment yet to come. Fortunately for Globe it wasn’t all bad. I got the app working for now but not after a big headache. 

The Cash In from Banks instructions need some updating. I tried to follow the instructions step by step. Eventually I experimented and found my way through. At least fix the East-West bank cash in instructions because that’s what I used so far. 

During Verification, the Link that’s supposed to lead to Terms and Conditions led me to the GCash Welcome/Advertisement Page. I suppose it was leading me to the little words at the bottom of page. 

I cannot adjust my Profile name without having to go through the tedious 3–Step Verification process. What gives?

Don’t trust your money with them,2020-01-04 12:59:40,1,myja r.,False,"If there is a rating with 0 stars, I would have given it. This app is worthless. They offer too may side services like investments, savings and charity donation tools but they can’t even fix the most basic feature of being able to cash in conveniently. How can we avail other services within this app if we can’t put in our money first? 

I am a fully verified user but eversince I installed this app, I’m unable to link my gcash to any bank account and or even cash in with other online options like using paypal or my credit/debit card. This app always has too many technical issues to begin with. Also, since I can’t link it with any bank account, withdrawing money from here is a challenge as well. And yes, you have the option of simply going to convenience stores to put money in your gcash too but it defeats the purpose of having the app. Why bother installing this when you can’t settle your basic matters through a touch of a finger?

The worst part is that the live support is totally useless and will keep asking the same questions and details that are unrelated to the issue you reported. After days of going in circles, I totally gave up talking to them. Also, I wouldn’t trust a service wherein several different staff will keep on asking for my bank account details. This is very unsecure and could impose potential privacy and security issues to the user.

If you have the guts to spill your private info and have no fear of potentially losing money, then be my guest and keep using this service, otherwise, don’t waste your time installing this app. Find another company that has a more reputable and stable cash in service.",gcash,520020791,

"The best in PH, because it’s the only thing we can settle for here",2021-04-24 01:39:51,2,Halmeoni51,False,"The app boasts of its growth and tech expertise in PH, and tbh, it’s true that it is advanced. But looking at the tech landscape, GCash monopolizes the market being the only full-stack virtual wallet there. Obviously it would land the top spot. I would receive top honors too if I were the only person in the class, even if my scores were abysmal.

Pit it against international apps and it falls hella short.

Going through the experience of the app alone shows that it lacks proper UX and upkeep to provide a seamless journey per action. Wala lang talaga ibang option ang Pinoy, so they settle for this award-winning-but-really-mediocre app.

I hope GCash has a faster tat to iron out the persistent bugs, the constant crashes, the clunkiness of the overall feel, and many more. Better live up to your awards & recognitions. Numbers from 2020 speak of necessity and not the prowess of the app.

Bugs, to name a few:
1. Persistent errors in GForest - either energy not reflecting or energy stolen causes app to crash.
2. Enrolled cash in banks do not reflect from time to time. One ends up having to repeatedly enroll the same bank whenever it disappears.
3. Enrolling bills is a frikin pain. Why can’t I enroll my CCs so I can regularly pay? I can only enroll Meralco and Globe. Why?!
4. Have you ever heard of consistent autofill? In paying bills, it’s a hit or miss. Sometimes autofill works, but 80% of the time it doesn’t. If you wanna instill habit, then make it easier for the consumer.
5. Cash in amount. I’ve used GCash since 2019. Obviously I am entitled to the max daily cash in. How come lately I’m unable to do this?

Looking forward to bug fixes + the app to actually live up to its claim as a functional virtual wallet. Alipay has robust tech resources to help support your enhancements. Best to maximize it.",gcash,520020791,

App is horrible,2020-03-18 14:44:27,1,23xealmalya,False,"Hi, this is my 2nd time of sending u an email how frustrated I am as ur app user.. not to mention the Previous Issue i have with u guys which it has not been answered yet.. i was promised that someone will get in touch of me to clarify things bit it never happened. I am just wondering why you guys are keep on running this app if the service is not working most of the times. Yesterday i tried to add money to my acct, went to several partners u guys have and i ended up sending the money through them instead using my app for me to save some money. However as a customer u cant do anything but to keep on murmuring how bad the app is.. it shows here in the application that we can get money over the counter through tour partners. i tried that a lot of times and keep on asking is to why they cant process it.. they will just answer me that its with GCASH on their end ur app does kot works fine and most of the time its offline..GCASH why are u doing this things to ur customers? Dont u think its a waste of time for us?? How come ur able to keep this app working and u guys doesnt even care if were able to use it or not. Tried calling a lot of times and i dont get answers from ur agents.. some of ur agents are nit familiar with the options that u guys have. Have them trained pls,,!! Now going to my issue. Now it says here under borrow load that i can borrow load and ill be deducted as soon as ill add money to my gcash acct.. now that option is still there but it does not allow me to borrow the load.. its important for me coz as of this time i need to get in touch with my family and i cant go outside to buy load coz of the curfew.i cant do it coz the community is under quarantine.. now i dont see that u guys are being helpful to us people.. pretty much i will make sure that ill report ur app and give u bad ratings and provide u comments that can awaken ur sense for u guys to check on the app itself..

Never Again,2018-08-24 12:12:53,1,Rieyuxel,False,"TL;DR this is a short summary of my horrible experience with Globe’s GCASH feature and customer service team. Bottom line is DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK ALL THE TIME AND IF IT DID NOT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CALL THEIR HOTLINE AND WAIT FOR 20-30 MINS BEFORE GETTING A REP. 

I have been having issues with the GCash Card for weeks now. 

The system keeps saying no payment has been processed yet it already deducted money from my account. This happened twice when I attempted to buy credits from Grab and another when I was trying to pay for my cc bill. 

When I had the issue with my cc bill, I had no choice but to call the hotline, it was already past my due date. I had to pay a penalty fee because of it, so I was at least expecting that the bill will post after a few business days but it just consumed the money AGAIN! The rep told me, guaranteed with all his might, that the payment went thru, that it was what he saw in their system. After 3-4 days, the money went back to my GCash account. What he told me was a lie. I waited almost 30 minutes just to get a rep to talk to and my issue just resolved by itself without your company’s help. He also told me that the cause might be some sort of bug or glitch and that he already escalated it, but the bad news is he cannot tell when it will be fixed. 

I relied on GCash because I pay most of my bills here. I buy load for my friends and family here. It’s very convenient, but this fiasco has convinced me that I CANNOT RELY NOR DEPEND ON YOUR SYSTEM AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is money we’re talking about! This is the money we work hard to earn everyday, but based on your system issues, it’s clear that you are not on top of this at all which makes your system unreliable.

It has been a very frustrating and unpleasant experience. Just to add to that, my money got consumed again today. I never learn, do I? This will be the last time. I enrolled my bill payments to an alternative. I don’t want to use this service ever again.",gcash,520020791,

I have been following up on my problem since Tuesday, December 18, 2018 and have not received any resolution from any of the Gcash support team.

On Monday, December 17, I still keep getting the same error message.

On Tuesday, December 18, I called up GCash and the agent logged in a report stating my problem of being unable to withdraw my remaining balance. When she finished her report, she gave me the reference number and told me to follow up on my problem after two (2) business days.

On Wednesday, December 19, I tried to check again using a different bank ATM. I still got the same error message 

Today, I spoke with another Gcash agent (Christian) and he typed up a new report once more.

To sum it all up, I could NOT withdraw from any ATM machine. I could NOT do cash out. I could NOT pay using QR. And I have not exceeded my monthly limit, because my total for this month is below 100K!

I have ALWAYS experienced several setbacks with GCash, and yet I continued to use it. Until now.

This is my hard-earned money which I need to withdraw from my GCash account ASAP. 

I just need my money back ASAP and the Gcash support team has been unwilling to offer help in any form. Do they really exist or are they merely a fabrication of the company?

My greatest greatest concern is that with the holiday season underway, support staff may be going on vacation and my case will be left hanging and will only be attended to after the New Year.

But thanks to Gcash because I can transfer money from Paypal to Gcash instantly and take note, FOR FREE!! This is soooo amazing! Really!! Transfer of funds from BPI to Gcash requires you first to go to your bank and fill up an application form before you can use that feature!

This is really awesome plus I get real time updates and confirmation when money is transferred and withdrawn.

  Hoping that one day there is some option for the OFW that wants to have an account on Gcash or any E-wallet,This is only my suggestion and if that happen maybe all OFW around the world will be getting E-wallet’s that they can use with their own simcard from other country..Thank you",gcash,520020791,

Sending money, paying bills and transferring to other banks have never been easier. However, I would also like to add some points that could polish this app to perfection. 

i). Wallet Update Notifications - Whenever a user received money, it would be a great addition to see it in the notification center and not received via SMS text. Also, it would be nice to have the option to choose where to receive wallet updates (email/phone/app).

ii). GCash Username - Phone number is one of the most personal things that should not be shared with anyone specially a stranger on the internet. Furthermore, it would be easier and privacy-focused to give a username and receive money through it than sharing personal phone number. Something like $G.SAMPLEUSERNAME would be cool to have.

iii). Minimalistic UI - Make GCash more minimalistic iOS look. This is only a personal preference but it would be a great addition for this fantastic app.",gcash,520020791,

Features/Offers are becoming more and more unattractive,2021-01-30 04:36:48,3,AedieB.,False,"I gave the app 3 stars because personally, it has helped me a lot in my finances for the past years. It made saving, fund/bank transfers, and paying bills easier and more convenient. 

However, now, the features are becoming less pro-users. Unlike before that bank transfer fees are waived; now, it costs P15.00 per transaction. The buy-load feature used to offer a 10% instant rebate, then reduced to 5%, then 4%, and now, they have scratchcards that give users a chance to win load vouchers, cashbacks, and QR vouchers (that are seeded to the user’s account but very delayed or are not even seeded). Worse, customer service is less responsive.

Despite all these, I will continue to use the app as it is very useful in paying bills. But I hope they will improve its features. Also, please edit your app description/features that it offers 4% cashback for buy-load transactions, because it really doesn’t. Thank you.",gcash,520020791,

I didn’t even spend a dime when it was January. Also, I haven’t even reached the spending limit of 5k, I’m below that very much. Please look into it, my number is +09667456870. I’m still stuck in Basic level, I’ve sent dozen of applications for semi verification last November 2020. None of them were acknowledged or seen. (November, 2, 2020, and waiting....)

Improve your customer service, and your really frustrating glitchy app. I just want to spend my last money there, sadly I can’t because of your glitchy app, and I’d be deleting this app from my phone whenever I’ve made sure I’d spend everything inside my account. I’m not leaving a cent.

Gcash app will only show Cherry C. no matter what the full name is and the sender will think it’s the same person until they sent the money then the txt message will show the whole name and confirmed it was the wrong person. It’s so hard to get back the money. Some people will not send it back. Gcash service is usually out of reach so really not helpful in getting the money back. So please, just let the app show the whole name. There’s a lot of people in the world or Philippines that has the same name and same initials, its so hard to identify who is who.

PLEASE BE AWARE OF GCash!!!!! THEY ARE GODDAMN THIEVES!!! SOBRA NA TALAGA!! 

ONCE IS ENOUGH!! TWICE IS FUCKING TOO MUCH!!

I cashed in the 10,300php from BDO. I cashed in the 4,920php from Security Bank.

Last April 3, I Cashed In 10,300php through my linked Debit Card ( BDO ) but it did not reflect sa Gcash yet  na sa account ko. I received a text saying it cannot be processed at the moment. So I waited 24 hours hoping magreflect pero wala talaga. 

I contacted Gcash Support and was told na it is unsuccessful on their end so there's nothing they can do about it. So I contacted BDO, I was advised that it is successful and I should contact Gcash to have it credited.

I contacted Gcash again and they told me the same thing which is it is unsuccessful. I told them what BDO told me and they said they will escalate it. Since then, araw araw ako natawag for an update pero laging wala hanggang sa mapagod na ako.

After 17 days of waiting, they sent me an email telling me it is really unsuccessful and I should coordinate with BDO. They said they will provide me a Formal Letter certifying that it is unsuccessful to provide sa Bank.

I submitted a dispute sa BDO but it was declined due to lack of supporting documents. Since then wala pa din yung Formal Letter na need ko. Araw araw nagsesend ako ng email. Formal letter nalang hindi pa maibigay!! 10,300php is not a joke!!

Since then, nakakapag Cash In ako ng mga small amounts para sa load. All those transactions walang issue. 

Now, I cashed in again amounting 4920php through linked Debit Card ( SecurityBank ). I got an error yet the money has been taken out of my SB account. For the second time!!! 

So pag small amounts, no issues. Pag malaking amounts, nagdidisappear!!! 

HINDI PA AKO NAKAKA MOVE ON SA 10k!! Fresh na fresh pa sa utak ko mga hayup na to!! 

NAKUKUHA NYO PA MAGNAKAW SA CRISIS NGAYON!! 

Hindi ako nagsalita or nagpost nung sa 10k at hinayaan ko. Pero maulit nanaman?! Dyusko!!

One: I got myself fully verified, the app had the label but I could still not access everything it promised — invest, save, etc. What’s worse is that I keep having to reverify myself over and over and could not get my profile updated and access the upgraded features. Two: even after multiple times of verification, even if I add my address correctly, on the profile page, it does not reflect the correct one. Three: I followed the instructions to add an email address but I can’t get the damn thing updated, Ikeep getting an error message “oops. Something went wrong.” I guess, it may be right.

Weakened security features of the MC atm card,2019-12-21 21:31:40,2,Ch09912,False,"I'm so disappointed. I was at a crowded mall by 3pm. I paid in cash for my purchases, hence- no need to bring out any atm card.

Around 6pm, 2882 sent SMS that ""Sorry, your balance is insufficient to complete the transaction."" Even I'm not using the card! It's on my desk, I panicked (ofcourse). 

Apparently, my newly linked GCash MasterCard was easily skimmed while in my purse, (thru NFC or RFID by sophisticated hackers) I'm just shopping for holiday gifts. 

It's like someone wanted to do Unauthorized Transaction because GCash also works as prepaid debit/credit card. 

[Cover all you want, but these hackers are getting advanced as well; they can scan thru your wallet or bag with their stealth apparatus. Especially this holiday season. Easy online shopping for them, ha!]

I thought, the security of GCash MasterCard has strengthened since it's valid until 2027. NOPE.

Yet, 2882 SMS warned me that someone's trying to hack into it, but failed due to only P4.00 balance. 

What if... about P4,000.00 or 40,000.00 in my GCash wallet? Will OTP even work? Will GCash trace the hacker & give my money back? NOPE. Then, I'm probably broke this Holiday season! 

Good thing, I transferred my funds to another bank.

Precaution: put Void shiny stickers on CVV# at the back of your cards to prevent this from happening to you. I lost P150.00 since it didn't even last for a month, and someone got into it easily.",gcash,520020791,

So, I reported it. Thinking that it was just a random error, I tried to transfer the same amount today, and guess what, I received the same error and another Php9,000.00 was deducted, which I reported again. Imagine, 18K in limbo somewhere. I did some digging on my own and found out that there’s a monthly transaction limit of 100K for incoming and outgoing funds combined. I did not know about it unlit now. 

This things should not be hidden from customers in the Help section as no one might even think that there’s a limit since it’s our money.

1. Everytime I cash-in with BPI via gcash I get billed for 9.09 on my postpaid number which is registered to gcash. I get billed for every SMS I received notifying me for a successful  cash in transaction. Like the fVck?

2. I have experienced issues while paying my bills.  When you pay your bill, it actually requires you to reply back with a code, however I have received an error before I can even reply, yet my gcash account was already deducted. This happens twice. 

3. The app crashes that you end up having duplicate payments. Happens to me twice.

3. Lastly, their customer service takes a month to resolved the issue. They request so many information and whats frustrating is they get back to you asking for the same information. Like hell no.

I’m done with this app.",gcash,520020791,

NEVER USE THEIR PAY BILLS!!!,2019-02-01 02:21:59,1,JheJha,False,"They claim that it is convenient to use their pay bills services. But my experience had been very stressful.

They have deducted two times from my account when I tried to use their pay bills service amounting P5350. I was deducted P10700! I called immediately to reverse back my money. I called 2882 but there is no option to talk to an agent. So I called 211 and had to ask them to transfer my call to their GCash department.

The first agent I talked to told me that there will be 3-5 working days turn around time for the to reverse the second deduction. (Take note, it was their system’s fault that I have been deducted twice, and I will have to wait that long!?!)

I followed up 3 working days after, the agent told me to wait until 5th working days and follow up again.

I called again on the 5th working day. I was very angry. I have waited 1 hour on queue plus the 1 week turn around time they told me but their answer was to wait for another 24 hours. I insisted that they resolve my issue right away so the agent put me on hold for another 30 FREAKING MINUTES THEN DROPPED THE CALL!

I called again and waited for another hour on queue. I asked the agent to transfer my call to a supervisor and waited another 30 minutes before the call was tranfered. They say that they are contacting their support team which were very unresponsive. Only then that I receive an email that I have to send some documents for them to do the reversal. WHAT HAPPEND TO THE 3-5 WORKING DAYS TURN AROUND TIME? They did nothing!!! I have to be very furious for them to take actions!

I have been on the call with the supervisor for more than 1 hour but nothing happened, her only response was that the support team is still waiting for the response of the support from the third party. The supervisor promised to call the next day to update me of the progress.

The hours had passed and I didn’t receive any call. So I called AGAIN and waited AGAIN another hour on queue. The agent I talked to told me that they are still for their support team’s response. I said I will not end the call until they resolve my issue. I was literally on call for 8 hours! The call had been dropped a few times having reached the 2 hours limit.

Their final response is that I would have contact the biller ang fix the issue myself (WHICH WAS THEIR SYSTEM’S FAULT) or I would have to wait 1-2 FREAKING MONTHS for them to return my money. I freaked out! WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THEIR MISTAKE? WHY WON’T THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY? It is hard-earned money we are talking about. P5350 may be small amount for some of you but it is a VERY BIG DEAL to me. I could accept their answer so I asked to be tranfered to a supervisor.

The supervisor just said that, ‘That’s all, that’s that. We can no longer offer any more help.’ Asked him to transfer me ro someone with higher position who help resolve my issue but he insisted that there is noone.

WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT?!

I t maybe veiwed as advanced payment to my biller but that was way out of budget! For someone like me who every cents counts, it would be a big loss. The physical and emotional stressed this experience had caused me was WAS WAY MORE damaging.

I WILL NEVER EVER USE YOUR PAY BILLS SERVICES EVER AGAIN.
