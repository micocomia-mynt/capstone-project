since it is system generated okay it was system generated but why did they deactivate my account and again there was no link to reactivate it the customer service agent said that i need to upgrade my

required me to upgrade my virtual card 3 kindly disregard this message in case you have already settled all pending charges  settled all pending charges what pending charges as far as i know i have

knowing that i have a deactivated account at the moment i cannot see my virtual card in the app unless i place p100 in my account as i see it seems that paymaya is forcing its users to upgrade the
