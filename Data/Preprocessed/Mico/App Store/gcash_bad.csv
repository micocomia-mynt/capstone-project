their cs agents are so lazy and do not even read properly your concerns they just send you responses which are obviously taken out from a template i know this because their responses to me are too far from the actual concern they just send out generic replies maybe so that it can be said that they responded

i am a fully verified user but eversince i installed this app I am unable to link my gcash to any bank account and or even cash in with other online options like using paypal or my creditdebit card this app always has too many technical issues to begin with also since i can not link it with any bank account withdrawing money from here is a challenge as well and yes you have the option of simply going to convenience stores to put money in your gcash too but it defeats the purpose of having the app why bother installing this when you can not settle your basic matters through a touch of a finger

the worst part is that the live support is totally useless and will keep asking the same questions and details that are unrelated to the issue you reported after days of going in circles i totally gave up talking to them also i would not trust a service wherein several different staff will keep on asking for my bank account details this is very unsecure and could impose potential privacy and security issues to the user

disappointed that you do not have a transaction limit tracker or warning 10k before the limit is reached i can not buy load transfer to my gsave shop online pay merchants through the app the app basically just became useless and a hassle oh the opportunity cost of having 10k just lying there wo interest after i reached the transaction limit

i have about 10k just sitting in my wallet not even in my gsave basically dead and not earning interest because i reached my transaction limit for the month 

i really hoped i was informed of my limit or accumulated transactions for each 10k mark

i just hope that they will soon focus on resolving the issues that this app has and not just keep on adding additional features 

anyways for those who were dealing with certain problems that you yourself can not seem to solve i recommend using the submit ticket feature that the help centre has it may be a hassle but still better than to stress yourself out

we cannot load our mobile data and pay bills and stuffs because it is almost everyday or every week that they do maintenance affecting the whole gcash app

please be aware of gcash they are goddamn thieves sobra na talaga 

once is enough twice is fucking too much

i cashed in the 10300php from bdo i cashed in the 4920php from security bank

last april 3 i cashed in 10300php through my linked debit card  bdo  but it did not reflect sa gcash yet  na sa account ko i received a text saying it cannot be processed at the moment so i waited 24 hours hoping magreflect pero wala talaga 

i contacted gcash support and was told na it is unsuccessful on their end so there is nothing they can do about it so i contacted bdo i was advised that it is successful and i should contact gcash to have it credited

i contacted gcash again and they told me the same thing which is it is unsuccessful i told them what bdo told me and they said they will escalate it since then araw araw ako natawag for an update pero laging wala hanggang sa mapagod na ako

after 17 days of waiting they sent me an email telling me it is really unsuccessful and i should coordinate with bdo they said they will provide me a formal letter certifying that it is unsuccessful to provide sa bank

i submitted a dispute sa bdo but it was declined due to lack of supporting documents since then wala pa din yung formal letter na need ko araw araw nagsesend ako ng email formal letter nalang hindi pa maibigay 10300php is not a joke

since then nakakapag cash in ako ng mga small amounts para sa load all those transactions walang issue 

now i cashed in again amounting 4920php through linked debit card  securitybank  i got an error yet the money has been taken out of my sb account for the second time 

so pag small amounts no issues pag malaking amounts nagdidisappear 

hindi pa ako nakaka move on sa 10k fresh na fresh pa sa utak ko mga hayup na to 

nakukuha nyo pa magnakaw sa crisis ngayon 

hindi ako nagsalita or nagpost nung sa 10k at hinayaan ko pero maulit nanaman dyusko 

and they have the worst customer service lagi ididisconnect call mo

may mga nakausap ako na same nangyari malalaking amounts din hindi maibalik ng gcash until sumuko nalang sila at hinayaan

this is a good app for cashless transactions but still has a lot to improve here are the problems i am experiencing 
1 when i link my bpi account here it is weird that it will not take the password for my bpi app i ended changing my password in bpi for 6 times it always show that the password is wrong so the bpi app blocked my account and password needed to be changed

2 transaction history  i think it would be great if the transaction history shows the receipt generated after the transaction and by the way sending the transaction history to my email is not working

3 in addition to the transactiob history when i exportsave the transaction receipt to my phone it is cut off in the middle i do not know why but yes it is cut off right in the middle

4 some fields are not working  i am saving bir as a biller but when i tap on preferred biller name it is not working hence i cannot save this biller and i have to go through the usual process when i pay bills 

i hope these bugs in the app can be addressed it is a financial app and highly utilized money is being handled so it has to be really working efficiently

so there is a na in my middle name on gcash which paypal does not accept  i talked with many people many agents many teams and they are way too unprofessional 
how difficult is it to delete a middle name
they are just trolling me by asking many many many questions and transferring me to the next team
yes to the next team and the cycle starts again 

they asked many personal and high security questions and requirements such as signature and selfie and every single id you have
and then after that nothing

pit it against international apps and it falls hella short

going through the experience of the app alone shows that it lacks proper ux and upkeep to provide a seamless journey per action wala lang talaga ibang option ang pinoy so they settle for this awardwinningbutreallymediocre app

i hope gcash has a faster tat to iron out the persistent bugs the constant crashes the clunkiness of the overall feel and many more better live up to your awards  recognitions numbers from 2020 speak of necessity and not the prowess of the app

bugs to name a few
1 persistent errors in gforest  either energy not reflecting or energy stolen causes app to crash
2 enrolled cash in banks do not reflect from time to time one ends up having to repeatedly enroll the same bank whenever it disappears
3 enrolling bills is a frikin pain why can not i enroll my ccs so i can regularly pay i can only enroll meralco and globe why
4 have you ever heard of consistent autofill in paying bills it is a hit or miss sometimes autofill works but 80 of the time it does not if you want to instill habit then make it easier for the consumer
5 cash in amount I have used gcash since 2019 obviously i am entitled to the max daily cash in how come lately I am unable to do this
